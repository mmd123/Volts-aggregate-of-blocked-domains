# Volts-aggregate-of-blocked-domains
Figured I'd make an aggegation of domains that I'm blocking on my home network for anybody that cares to use the same blocks that I am, I make no guarantee of false positives, so use these at your own discretion, given that I do not put forth any effort to look over these for false positives, AKA USE AT YOUR OWN RISK, unblock things if you think they should not be blocked.

for the list of publicly available sources I used before my own modifications, please go here:  [Public Sources Used](/third party block lists I use)
