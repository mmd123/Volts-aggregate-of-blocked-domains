This will be the readme file for the public sources that I have used over time, in addition to my own list of blocks I have added myself from my general usage of the internet from day to day, should anybody want to use the same list of public sources on their own network for their own usage.

if its a public block list that I use, thats what will be here, if its a publicly available source that I then added myself by hand, that also will go here.

these will be very slow to get updated, so check  back whenever ya feel like doing so, stuff most likely will not have changed much.
